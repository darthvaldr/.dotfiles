# .dotfiles

## **TODO**
1. check all the files that need to be part of this repo are here
2. TEST RUN getting your terminal back up to exactly how you configured it with these steps. i.e. check this shit actually works rather than coming back to it (i.e. me, now) and find shits missing and the process is broken. sort it out bro.

## setup your $HOME

run this in your terminal to setup a repo to push your dotfiles to. it uses a 'config' alias to keep things nice & tidy.

* inits a git repo
* setups 'config' alias for a git-dir out of the way (.cfg)
* enable setting that hides untracked files
* echos our 'config' alias setup to ~/.bashrc for persistence

```bash
git init --bare $HOME/.cfg
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
echo "alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

## add some files to your dot
you know the drill, just remember you want 'config <add|commit|push|pull>' cos alias.

```bash
# add files
config add .bashrc

# add folders
config add .i3/*

# commit like usual (i know '-m' is bad practice, forgive me)
config commit -m "Add some files"
```

## setup your GIT

* create your github/bitbucket repo

example, my .dotfiles.git repo (remember 'config' is a bash alias setup in first step)

```bash
config remote add origin git@github.com:darthvaldr/.dotfiles.git
config push --set-upstream origin master
```

you will get an error for your troubles, because your github repo has files your local repo doesn't:

```bash
To git@github.com:darthvaldr/dotfiles.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:darthvaldr/dotfiles.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

rectify this with a pull:

```bash
config pull origin master

From github.com:darthvaldr/.dotfiles
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

then you should be good to 'config push' from here:

```bash
darthvaldr@localhost:~ $ config push --set-upstream origin master
